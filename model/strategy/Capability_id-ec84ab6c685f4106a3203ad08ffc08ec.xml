These processes include guiding resource events to an appropriate service, mediation of these usage records, as well as de-duplication of usage records already processed.  These processes provide information on customer-related and Service-related events to other process areas across assurance and billing. This includes reports on non-chargeable events and overcharged events and analysis of event records to identify fraud and prevent further occurrences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In many cases, this process is performed by a resource such as a network element.&#xD;&#xA;">
