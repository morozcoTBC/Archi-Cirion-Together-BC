The latter processes are responsible for deciding on and carrying out the appropriate action/response. This may include requests to the Resource Performance Management processes to install controls to optimize the specific resource performance.&#xD;&#xA;The Resource Performance Management processes will continue to track the resource performance problem, ensuring that resource performance is restored to a level required to support services.">
